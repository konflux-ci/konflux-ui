# Package Management

Konflux UI uses **Yarn** as the package manager. Always use `yarn` commands instead of `npm`.

## Reference

For detailed development commands and setup instructions, refer to:
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) - Contains yarn commands for development workflow
- [README.md](../README.md) - Setup and build instructions

## Key Points

- ✅ Use `yarn` commands (e.g., `yarn lint`, `yarn test`, `yarn tsc`)
- ❌ Don't use `npm` commands  
- Use `yarn.lock` (committed to repo)
- Never commit `package-lock.json`
